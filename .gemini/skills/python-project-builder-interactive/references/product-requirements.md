# Product Requirements

This document guides the process of defining clear and actionable product requirements.

## Key Principles:
*   **User Stories**: Focus on user needs and value. Format as "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: For each user story, define clear, testable conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
*   **Prioritization**: Work with the user to prioritize requirements (e.g., using MoSCoW: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have).

## Template for a Requirement:

*   **Acceptance Criteria**:

    *   ...
*   **Priority**: [Must-have/Should-have/Could-have/Won't-have]
